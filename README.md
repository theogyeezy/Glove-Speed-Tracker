# Baseball Catcher's Glove Speed Tracker

A computer vision application that processes video footage of baseball catchers to calculate and analyze glove speed.

## Overview

This application uses advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to track a baseball catcher's glove movements in video footage and calculate its speed. The system provides valuable insights for training, performance analysis, and player development.

## Features

- **Video Processing**: Support for various video formats (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV)
- **Glove Detection & Tracking**: Deep learning-based object detection and tracking
- **Speed Calculation**: Accurate measurement of glove speed in real-world units
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis of movement patterns and performance metrics
- **Visualization**: Real-time speed overlay and graphical representations
- **Reporting**: Comprehensive performance reports and data export
- **User Interface**: Web-based interface for easy video upload and result viewing
- **Cloud Deployment**: Ready for deployment on cloud platforms

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow
- **Data Science**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Web Interface**: Flask
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes
